# Hi, I'm Phoebe Lamb 🌍

**Data Analyst | International Affairs • Policy • Global Development | R • Python • SQL**

I use data to illuminate gaps in global attention—from **underreported conflicts** to **unfulfilled climate pledges** to **inequitable humanitarian responses**. My work asks: *What stories aren't making headlines? Are countries keeping their promises? Who's being left behind?*

**Currently:** Building a public portfolio demonstrating how data analytics can drive accountability in international affairs, climate policy, and humanitarian response.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🌍 **Conflict Deaths vs Humanitarian Aid: The Attention Gap**

**Question:** Do the deadliest conflicts receive proportional humanitarian funding?

**Finding:** When attention focuses on certain conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan), humanitarian aid follows. But many devastating crises—**Ethiopia's intercommunal violence**, **Mali's insurgencies**, **Eastern DRC's displacement**—receive far less funding despite massive human cost.

**Impact:** Reveals systematic gaps in humanitarian response, showing which populations are chronically overlooked.

**Question:** Are major economies cutting emissions fast enough to meet 2030 targets?

**Finding:** **4 of 5 countries are off track**—some need to cut **2.7× faster** to meet their own pledges.

**Impact:** Provides transparent accountability for climate pledges using reproducible methods.

**Question:** Are the biggest polluters funding climate action proportionally?

**Finding:** Emissions explain only **40%** of climate finance (R²=0.403)—revealing major fairness gaps:
- 🇰🇷 South Korea: Rank 3 emitter, Rank 12 funder ($1.54/ton)
- 🇫🇷 France: Rank 9 emitter, Rank 3 funder ($27.26/ton)
- 🇺🇸 USA: #1 emitter, only $2.34/ton (14× less efficient than Norway)

**Impact:** Quantifies climate finance inequity—essential for fairness debates.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

> *"When data meets humanity, we see not just numbers, but stories that demand our attention."*

I'm fortunate to analyze data while millions worldwide face uncertainty about their next meal or safe place to sleep. That reality fuels my work.

**My approach:**
- 🔍 **Illuminate the overlooked** - conflicts that don't make headlines
- 📊 **Drive accountability** - hold countries to their commitments  
- 💡 **Make it accessible** - translate complexity into clarity
- 🔬 **Stay rigorous** - transparent methods, reproducible code

I'm building this portfolio **in real-time** on LinkedIn and GitHub—showing, not just telling, what I can do.

## 📚 Background

**Master of Science in Business Analytics**  
Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business

**Why MSBA + International Affairs?**  
Data analytics is underutilized in international policy. I'm building the bridge between analytical rigor and policy impact—demonstrating that data can drive accountability in global cooperation, climate action, and humanitarian response.
