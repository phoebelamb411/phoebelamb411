# Hi, I’m Phoebe 🌍  

**MSBA Candidate at Georgetown University | Data Analyst | Focused on Conflict, Humanitarian Aid & Global Development**  

I use data to uncover human stories behind global challenges — building analytics that highlight where aid, attention, and outcomes don’t always align. My long-term goal is to apply this work to **international affairs, peacebuilding, and humanitarian outreach** — with the dream of contributing to global cooperation in The Hague.

## 📂 Portfolio Projects  

- 📊 **Conflict & Humanitarian Aid (2024 data)**  
  Visualized mismatches between deaths in major conflicts and humanitarian funding allocations.  
  → Found striking disparities: some conflicts with **high casualty counts receive relatively less aid visibility**.  
      [View project](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Conflict_and_Humanitarian_aid)  

- 🌱 **Paris Agreement – Part 1 (Oct 2025, in progress)**  
  Comparing countries’ pledged emissions reductions vs. their actual emissions since 2015.  

- 💰 **Paris Agreement – Part 2 (coming Oct 2025)**  
  Contrasting who emits most vs. who contributes most to climate finance.  

- 📚 **Global Education Access (planned Nov 2025)**  
  Analyzing literacy and digital access trends across regions, with a focus on youth empowerment.  

- 🕊️ **Peace & Diplomacy Successes (planned Dec 2025)**  
  Mapping regions where peace agreements reduced violence (e.g., Colombia, Ethiopia-Eritrea).

## 🌟 What Drives Me  

I believe **data should serve people** — especially in contexts where voices and struggles often go unseen.  
Through my projects, I aim to:  
- Spotlight underreported conflicts and disparities in aid.  
- Highlight progress in climate, education, and health.  
- Build a trail of **analytics for good** that reflects both skill and passion.  

For me, every dataset is more than numbers — it’s an opportunity to tell a story that matters.
