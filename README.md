# Hi, I’m Phoebe 🌍  
**MSBA Candidate at Georgetown University | Global Development & Policy | R/Python/SQL**

I build transparent, reproducible analytics that surface the human stories in global data — highlighting where pledges, funding, and outcomes don’t always align. My goal is to bring this lens to international affairs, peacebuilding, and humanitarian outreach, with the long-term ambition of contributing to global cooperation.

## 📂 Portfolio

### 📊 Conflict & Humanitarian Aid (2024)
Visualizes the mismatch between conflict deaths and humanitarian funding.  
**Findings:** Some of the deadliest crises receive disproportionately low funding and visibility.

### 🌱 Paris Agreement — Part 1 (Completed • Oct 2025)
Are countries cutting fast enough to hit their 2030 targets?  
I compare **pledged reductions (NDCs)** to **actual GHG emissions since 2015** and label on/off-track.

**Highlights**
- UK is the only one of my first 5 cases *roughly on pace*; USA/EU/Japan/Canada need faster cuts.
- Reproducible R pipeline: tidyverse, clean paths with `here`, auto-saves charts & a summary CSV.
- Clear visuals: per-country line charts + a bar chart of projected 2030 vs target.

### 💰 Paris Agreement — Part 2 (Planned • Oct 2025)
Who emits most vs who funds climate action?  
**Goal:** Compare emissions shares with climate-finance contributions to show who’s carrying the load.

### 📚 Global Education Access (Planned • Nov 2025)
Tracking literacy & digital access for youth, with regional gaps and trendlines.

### 🕊️ Peace & Diplomacy Wins (Planned • Dec 2025)
Where peace agreements drove real reductions in violence (e.g., Colombia, Ethiopia-Eritrea).

## 🌟 What Drives Me
Data should serve people. I use transparent methods and open data to:
- Spot under-reported needs (conflict/aid, climate gaps).
- Highlight measurable progress where it’s happening.
- Build a public track record of **analytics for good**.
