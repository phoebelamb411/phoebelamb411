# Hi, I’m Phoebe 🌍  

**MSBA Candidate at Georgetown University | Data Analyst | Focused on Conflict, Humanitarian Aid & Global Development**  

I use data to uncover human stories behind global challenges — building analytics that highlight where aid, attention, and outcomes don’t always align. My long-term goal is to apply this work to **international affairs, peacebuilding, and humanitarian outreach** — with the dream of contributing to global cooperation in The Hague.

## 🌟 What Drives Me  

I believe **data should serve people** — especially in contexts where voices and struggles often go unseen.  
Through my projects, I aim to:  
- Spotlight underreported conflicts and disparities in aid.  
- Highlight progress in climate, education, and health.  
- Build a trail of **analytics for good** that reflects both skill and passion.  

For me, every dataset is more than numbers — it’s an opportunity to tell a story that matters.
