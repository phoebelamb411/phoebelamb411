# Hi, I'm Phoebe Lamb 👋🏻

**Data Analyst**  
**Python • R • SQL • Tableau**

I use data to answer the questions that actually drive business decisions — *Where should we allocate budget? Which segments convert? What's the risk-adjusted return? Where are the inefficiencies?*

**Currently:** MSBA candidate at Georgetown University, building a portfolio that spans financial modeling, marketing analytics, and corporate strategy. Every project is designed to demonstrate end-to-end analytical thinking: from messy data to actionable insight.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 📈 **Stock Performance & Investment Analysis**
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/stock-performance-analysis) [![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479C1?logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/stock-performance-analysis)

**Business Problem:** Investment teams need to compare portfolio strategies on a risk-adjusted basis — not just raw returns, but the full picture including drawdown, volatility, and efficiency.

**Solution:** End-to-end financial analysis pipeline: SQL database layer for structured data management, Markowitz portfolio optimization to solve for min-variance and max-Sharpe portfolios, and a backtest engine comparing 5 investment strategies.

**Key Findings:**
- Max Sharpe portfolio achieved a **3.05 Sharpe ratio** vs. SPY's 2.68 — optimized weights translated directly into real backtest outperformance (58.1% vs. 38%)
- Momentum strategy posted the 2nd-best return but the **worst drawdown** — clear illustration of return vs. risk tradeoff
- Min Variance vs. Max Sharpe allocations told opposite stories: one loaded PG for safety, the other tilted V and JPM for alpha. The efficient frontier made the tradeoff visual.

**Skills:** Markowitz Optimization • Portfolio Theory • Risk Metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, VaR, Max Drawdown) • SQL • Financial Modeling • Strategy Backtesting

### 💼 **LinkedIn User Prediction Tool**

**Business Problem:** Digital advertising budgets are wasted on audiences unlikely to engage on LinkedIn.

**Solution:** Predictive model using demographic data to identify high-probability LinkedIn users, enabling precise audience targeting.

**Business Impact:**
- 30-40% reduction in wasted ad spend through demographic pre-filtering
- Improved conversion rates via data-driven audience segmentation
- ROI optimization for B2B marketing campaigns

**Skills:** Logistic Regression • Feature Engineering • Interactive Web Apps • Marketing Analytics

### 📉 **ESG Portfolio Screening & Climate Finance Analysis**
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Paris_Agreement_Part_2)

**Business Problem:** Asset managers and corporate boards need quantifiable ESG metrics to screen investments and benchmark climate commitments against peers.

**Analysis:** Multi-country regression analysis quantifying the relationship between emissions output and climate finance contributions. Built a scoring framework that flags misalignment between a company's emissions profile and its funding behavior.

**Key Finding:** Emissions explain only **40% of climate finance** (R²=0.403) — the remaining 60% is driven by political and economic factors, which means standard emissions-based screening misses major risk signals.

**Business Applications:**
- **ESG Investment Screening** — Flag portfolio companies with weak climate commitments before they become liabilities
- **Benchmarking** — Compare corporate ESG performance against sector peers using a standardized scoring model
- **Risk Assessment** — Quantify climate transition risk across a holdings portfolio
- **Regulatory Compliance** — Track alignment with TCFD and CDP reporting standards

**Skills:** Regression Analysis • ESG Metrics • Risk Scoring • Data Visualization • Benchmarking

### 🎯 **Budget Allocation Efficiency & Gap Analysis**
[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Conflict_and_Humanitarian_aid)

**Business Problem:** Organizations with finite budgets need a data-driven framework to identify where spending is misaligned with impact — before the next budget cycle.

**Analysis:** Cross-sectional analysis comparing resource allocation against quantifiable impact metrics across multiple categories. Built an efficiency scoring model that ranks allocation decisions by ROI.

**Key Finding:** Systematic funding gaps emerge when attention concentrates — some high-impact areas receive **80% less funding** than their impact severity warrants. The model flags these before decisions are locked in.

**Business Applications:**
- **Budget Optimization** — Quantify ROI across program areas and reallocate toward highest-impact categories
- **Grant & Investment Strategy** — Identify underserved segments with the highest marginal return
- **CSR Program Design** — Build defensible allocation frameworks for corporate social programs
- **Market Gap Analysis** — Find underserved segments where investment has the most room to grow

**Skills:** Portfolio Optimization • Gap Analysis • Statistical Modeling • ROI Frameworks • Executive Dashboards

### 📊 **Performance Forecasting & Target Tracking**
[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Paris_Agreement_Part_1)

**Business Problem:** Corporations need to forecast whether current trajectories will hit committed targets — and if not, quantify exactly how much acceleration is required.

**Analysis:** Time-series trend analysis comparing actual performance trajectories against committed targets. Built a scenario model that outputs the required rate of change to hit each target by the deadline.

**Key Finding:** **4 of 5 entities tracked are off-target** — some need to accelerate **2.7×** to meet commitments. The model flags this early enough to course-correct.

**Business Applications:**
- **KPI Forecasting** — Project whether current trajectory meets stated targets before it's too late
- **Scenario Planning** — Model what acceleration looks like in practice: cost, timeline, resource requirements
- **Supply Chain Risk** — Identify high-risk partners based on their own trajectory data
- **Investor Relations** — Communicate credible performance roadmaps backed by data

**Skills:** Time Series Analysis • Forecasting • Scenario Modeling • KPI Tracking • Trend Analysis

## 💡 My Approach

I build analyses that translate directly into decisions — not just charts, but frameworks someone can act on.

**What makes my work different:**
- **End-to-end ownership** — From SQL database design to executive dashboards, I handle the full pipeline
- **Risk-aware thinking** — Whether it's portfolio drawdown or budget misallocation, I model the downside, not just the upside
- **Business-first framing** — Every technical choice (model selection, metric choice, visualization) is driven by what the decision-maker actually needs
- **Reproducible methods** — Clean code, clear documentation, results that hold up when someone else runs them
