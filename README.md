### 📈 **Climate Finance & ESG Portfolio Analysis**
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Paris_Agreement_Part_2)

**Business Problem:** Asset managers and corporate boards need quantifiable ESG metrics to assess climate finance commitments.

**Analysis:** Multi-country regression analysis examining relationship between emissions output and climate finance contributions across major economies.

**Key Finding:** Emissions explain only **40% of climate finance** (R²=0.403), revealing systematic gaps:
- South Korea: Rank 3 emitter, Rank 12 funder ($1.54/ton CO₂)
- France: Rank 9 emitter, Rank 3 funder ($27.26/ton CO₂)
- USA: #1 emitter, only $2.34/ton (14× less efficient than Norway)

**Business Applications:**
- **ESG Investment Screening** - Identify portfolio companies with weak climate commitments
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Track corporate alignment with TCFD, CDP standards
- **Risk Assessment** - Quantify climate transition risk across holdings
- **Benchmarking** - Compare corporate ESG performance against industry peers

**Skills:** Regression Analysis • ESG Metrics • Data Visualization • Regulatory Reporting

[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Conflict_and_Humanitarian_aid)

**Business Problem:** Organizations with limited budgets need data-driven frameworks to identify where funding is misaligned with need.

**Analysis:** Cross-sectional analysis of resource allocation efficiency by comparing funding flows against quantifiable impact metrics.

**Key Finding:** Systematic funding gaps emerge when attention is concentrated—some high-need areas receive 80% less funding than expected based on impact severity.

**Business Applications:**
- **Foundation Grant Strategy** - Optimize philanthropic portfolio allocation
- **CSR Program Design** - Identify underserved stakeholder groups
- **Budget Optimization** - Quantify ROI across program areas
- **Market Gap Analysis** - Find underserved customer segments

**Skills:** Portfolio Optimization • Gap Analysis • Statistical Modeling • Executive Dashboards

[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/phoebelamb411/Paris_Agreement_Part_1)

**Business Problem:** Companies need to forecast whether they'll meet 2030 emissions reduction targets to avoid regulatory penalties and reputational risk.

**Analysis:** Time-series trend analysis comparing actual emissions trajectories against committed targets for major economies.

**Key Finding:** **4 of 5 countries off track**—some need to cut emissions **2.7× faster** to meet 2030 commitments.

**Business Applications:**
- **Corporate Sustainability Planning** - Project whether current trajectory meets Paris-aligned targets
- **Scenario Analysis** - Model required acceleration to meet net-zero commitments
- **Supply Chain Risk** - Identify high-risk suppliers in carbon-intensive sectors
- **Investor Relations** - Communicate credible decarbonization roadmaps

**Skills:** Time Series Analysis • Forecasting • Scenario Modeling • Trend Analysis • KPI Tracking
